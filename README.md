First project with Git
Hi - my name is Vicotr Fortunato and I am currently studying to obtain my BS in Computer Science with an emphasis in Software Engineering. I live in Mcloud, Oklahoma about 20 minutes east of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. I am a single dad of two children whom both rodeo. My daughter just turned 14 and she barrel races and my son who turned 10 in June rides bulls.
